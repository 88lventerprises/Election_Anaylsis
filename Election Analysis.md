# Election Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit

Our team has been tasked to assist a Colorado Board of Elections Employee, Tom, with an election audit of the tabular results for a US Congressional precinct. Tomâ€™s manager, Seth, would like to streamline these processes in Python, providing assistance with senatorial and local elections if the turn out is successful. We will preform our analysis on mail in ballots, punchcards, and direct reporting electronics. The aforementioned vote casting procedures are calculated by the following (respectively):

-	Hand counted
-	Machine Counted
-	Computer Counted

Our goal is to generate a vote count report as an audit tool of these election results. 

### Purpose 
Our team has been tasked with using Python to write algorithms that will assist with the confirmation and analysis of election results. Working directly with Tom and Seth, our team will be building upon our understanding of analysis relating to large data sets, leveraging our skillsets to provide the following outcomes:

-	Total number of votes cast
-	A complete list of candidates who received votes
-	Total number of votes each candidate received
-	Percentage of votes each candidate won
-	The winner of the election based on popular vote

## Election-Audit Summary

### Business Proposal

**Executive Summary**

Thank you Colorado Board of Elections Congressional District for engaging our team for this year's ballot audit. Our algorithm will provide an innovative aid in vote audit automation as our findings revealed an accurate summary of election outcomes. With its configurable aptitude this tool streamlines manual analysis and minimizes human-error.

**Our Approach**

Our pragmatic approach and clear understanding of deliverables allowed our team to expedited the following outcomes highlighted below (See Figure 1.1 A).  Created with the end-user in mind, across all congressional districts nationwide, municipal/local, state, federal, and national government entities can utilize this algorithm as a ubiquitous vote casting audit tool.

***Figure 1.1.A***

-	A complete list of candidates who received votes
-	Total number of votes each candidate received
-	Percentage of votes each candidate won
-	The winner of the election based on popular votes


#### **Additional Application**

A brief overview of future applications are as follows:

***Example A***

City government needs, by changing counties to municipal districts. Data on areas that are less favorable to a specific candidate can be leveraged to increase visibility and engagement for future campaigns.

***Example B***

This code can be configured to accommodate a national presidential election quantifying state and county contributions. A 'Boolean' or 'if' statement can also be of assistance for conditional analysis, determining political party and party dominance in a specific state.
