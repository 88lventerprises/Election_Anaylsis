# Election Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit

Our team has been tasked to assist a Colorado Board of Elections Employee, Tom, with an election audit of the tabular result for a US Congressional precinct. Tom’s manager, Seth, would like to streamline these processes in Python, providing assistance with senatorial and local elections if the turn out is successful. We will preform our analysis on mail in ballots, punch cards, and direct reporting electronics. The aforementioned vote casting procedures are calculated by the following (respectively):

-	Hand counted
-	Machine Counted
-	Computer Counted

Our goal is to generate a vote count report as an audit tool of these election results. 

### Purpose 
Our team has been tasked with using Python to write algorithms that will assist the confirmation and analysis of election results. Working directly with Tom and Tom’s manager Seth. Our team will be building upon our understanding of analysis relating to large data sets, leveraging our skillsets to provide the following outcomes:

-	Total number of votes cast
-	A complete list of candidates who received votes
-	Total number of votes each candidate received
-	Percentage of votes each candidate won
-	The winner of the election based on popular vote

## Election-Audit Summary
A configurable code such as this has a multitude of uses that would be beneficial for upcoming elections or any tally based computational need such as:

### **Additional Application**

***Example A***

- A) City government needs, by changing counties to municipal districts. Data on areas that are less favorable to a specific candidate can be leveraged to increase visibility and engagement for future campaigns.

***Example B***

This code can be configured to accommodate a national presidential election quantifying state and county contributions. A 'Boolean' or 'if' statement can come in determining political party and if it is dominant in a specific state.
